# pricesleuth

PriceSleuth is a school project developed for Brigham Young University - Idaho as part of my WDD330 - Frontend Development II class. The project integrates GitHub for version control and links to external tools such as Netlify for deployment, Node.js for backend operations, Trello for task management, and MS Visual Studio Code as the development environment. PriceSleuth allows users to compare prices between Walmart and Target, helping them find the best deals efficiently.
